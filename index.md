   I'm a _Computer Science, Mathematics and Machine learning enthusiast_ , working towards a BS in Computer Science at UC San Diego, with an expected graduation date of June 2023.

   I'm currently doing my research under _Prof Niema Moshiri_ to build **Scalable tools for studying viral evolution.** Our research is geared upon inferring properties of a real epidemic using only viral sequences learned from the various dependencies of virus transmissions and the patient's genomic sequences.

   In my free time, you can find me painting my heart out or hiking. I have also been part of a Teaching and Mentoring program for middle school and budding high school kids for the past 4 years. We have been working to increase Diversity and engagement of underepresented students in STEM fields.
   In the words of Itadori Yuji's Grandpa:

as much as you can.

# ***Research & Teaching***
1. **Undergraduate Researcher with ERSP**
   * _Oct 2020 - June 2020_
   
    * Advisors: **Professor Niema Moshiri**
      - Topic: Scalable tools for studying viral evolution and epidemiology
      - Taking advantage of the transmission history of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV which strongly influences genomic sequences of the viral smaple collected from patients.
      - Using these dependencies to somehow infer properties of a real epidemic using only virus sequences.
      - The goal of this project is to develop and use tools for studying viral evolution and tranmission from viral sequences collected from patients.
      - Some of the code from there would be:
         ```
         def get_time_difference_in_second(d1, d2):
            d1 = datetime.strptime(d1, '%Y-%m-%d')
            d2 = datetime.strptime(d2, '%Y-%m-%d')
            diff = d1-d2
            return diff.total_seconds()
         ```

2. **Web Development Intern @ NIC, Govt. of Chhattisgarh, India**
   * _Summer 2018 and 2019_ 
     - Developed a grievance redressal website for the villagers to replace the hefty manual process.
     - Researched and analyzed the population and designed a customized website
     - Online platform switchover helped 28,000 people including saving the daily wages of laborers.
     
3. **Summer 2021 Status**
     - [x] Secured an Internship at ServiceNow 
     - [ ] ~~Finished~~ Yet to finish up the last few steps of my research
     - [ ] Finish project on Gans
