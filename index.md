   I'm a Computer Science, Mathematics and Machine learning enthusiast, working towards a BS in Computer Science at UC San Diego, with an expected graduation date of June 2023.

   I'm currently doing my research under Prof Niema Moshiri to build Scalable tools for studying viral evolution. Our research is geared upon inferring properties of a real epidemic using only viral sequences learned from the various dependencies of virus transmissions and the patient's genomic sequences.

   In my free time, you can find me painting my heart out or hiking. I have also been part of a Teaching and Mentoring program for middle school and budding high school kids for the past 4 years. We have been working to increase Diversity and engagement of underepresented students in STEM fields.
   In the words of Itadori Yuji's Grandpa:

as much as you can.

1.  **Research & Teaching**
    * Oct 2020 - June 2020
    **Undergraduate Researcher with ERSP**
    * Advisors: **Professor Niema Moshiri** *
      - Topic: Scalable tools for studying viral evolution and epidemiology
      - Taking advantage of the transmission history of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV which strongly influences genomic sequences of the viral smaple collected from patients.
      - Using these dependencies to somehow infer properties of a real epidemic using only virus sequences.
      - The goal of this project is to develop and use tools for studying viral evolution and tranmission from viral sequences collected from patients.

```
git status
git add
git commit
```
3. **Status**
     - [x] Finish writing the code
     - [x] Push my commits to GitHub
     - [ ] Fix issues and update again
